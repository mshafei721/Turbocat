name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling with user-friendly messages, specific exception types, centralized handling, and graceful degradation. Use this skill when adding try-catch blocks, error boundaries, or exception handling. When creating custom error types or exception classes. When deciding where to handle errors (controller vs. service layer). When writing user-facing error messages. When implementing retry logic with exponential backoff. When ensuring resources are cleaned up in finally blocks or equivalent patterns.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding try-catch blocks or error handling code
- When creating custom error or exception classes
- When deciding where to catch and handle errors
- When writing error messages that users will see
- When implementing centralized error handling at API boundaries
- When designing systems to degrade gracefully on failure
- When implementing retry strategies for external service calls
- When using exponential backoff for transient failures
- When ensuring resources (connections, file handles) are cleaned up
- When validating inputs and failing fast with clear messages
- When choosing between specific and generic exception types
- When reviewing code for proper error handling patterns
