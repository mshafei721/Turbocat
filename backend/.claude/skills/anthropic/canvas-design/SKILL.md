# Canvas Design

## Overview

Create museum-quality visual designs by first establishing an aesthetic philosophy, then expressing it visually with minimal text. Work must demonstrate expert craftsmanship—designs that appear meticulously crafted and the product of deep expertise.

## Two-Step Process

### Step 1: Design Philosophy

Create a named aesthetic movement (1-2 words) with 4-6 paragraphs articulating how ideas manifest through:
- Space and negative space
- Form and structure
- Color and contrast
- Composition and balance

### Step 2: Canvas Expression

Translate philosophy into a single-page visual artifact emphasizing:
- Expert craftsmanship
- Visual philosophy expressed through design, not text
- Typography that is minimal and visual-first
- Nothing falls off the page and nothing overlaps
- Sophistication remains non-negotiable

## Design Philosophy Examples

**Brutalist Joy**: Raw geometric forms celebrating honest materials with unexpected bursts of color

**Chromatic Language**: Color gradients as narrative elements, speaking through hue transitions

**Analog Meditation**: Hand-drawn textures and organic imperfections creating warmth

**Geometric Silence**: Minimal shapes creating maximum impact through precise placement

## Key Principles

- Visual philosophy expressed through design, not text-heavy layouts
- Typography should be minimal and visual-first
- Most of the time, font should be thin
- Design should reach the frontier of aesthetic boundaries
- Flawless execution is required
- Every element serves the aesthetic concept

## Output Formats

- **PNG**: High-resolution raster output for digital display
- **PDF**: Vector output for print and scaling
