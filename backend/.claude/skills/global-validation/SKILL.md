name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive input validation with server-side security, client-side UX feedback, sanitization, and consistent error messages. Use this skill when validating user input in forms, API endpoints, or data processing. When writing validation rules for data types, formats, ranges, or required fields. When sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection). When providing field-specific error messages to users. When implementing validation at system boundaries like API endpoints or background jobs.

## When to use this skill:

- When validating user input from forms or UI
- When validating data at API endpoints
- When implementing server-side validation (required for security)
- When adding client-side validation for better UX
- When writing validation rules for data types and formats
- When checking ranges, lengths, or required fields
- When sanitizing input to prevent SQL injection or XSS
- When creating field-specific validation error messages
- When using allowlists instead of blocklists for validation
- When validating business rules (sufficient balance, valid dates)
- When ensuring consistent validation across all entry points
- When reviewing code for input sanitization and security
