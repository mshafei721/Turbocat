name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write focused, strategic tests for core user flows with behavior-based testing, clear naming, and proper mocking of external dependencies. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. When working on files in tests/, __tests__/, spec/, or *.test.ts, *.spec.ts files. When deciding what to test during feature development. When naming test cases descriptively. When mocking databases, APIs, or external services. When focusing on testing behavior rather than implementation details.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing new unit, integration, or e2e tests
- When modifying existing test files
- When working on files in tests/, __tests__/, spec/, or test/ directories
- When working on files like *.test.ts, *.spec.ts, *_test.py, *_spec.rb
- When deciding what code to test during feature development
- When choosing to test core user flows vs. edge cases
- When writing descriptive test names that explain expected outcomes
- When mocking databases, external APIs, or file systems
- When isolating units under test from dependencies
- When ensuring tests focus on behavior, not implementation
- When reviewing test code for clarity and maintainability
- When keeping test execution fast for developer feedback
