name: Backend Models
description: Define database models and schemas with proper naming, data types, constraints, relationships, and indexing strategies. Use this skill when creating or modifying database models, entity definitions, or schema files. When working on files like models.py, models/*.ts, entities/*.ts, schema.prisma, or ORM model definitions. When defining table structures, setting up foreign key relationships, adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE), choosing appropriate data types, or implementing model-level validation.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new database model or entity files
- When modifying existing model definitions
- When working on files in models/, entities/, or schema/ directories
- When defining table columns and their data types
- When setting up relationships between models (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys)
- When creating indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns
- When adding timestamps (created_at, updated_at) to models
- When implementing cascade behaviors for relationships
- When balancing database normalization with query performance
- When adding model-level validation rules
