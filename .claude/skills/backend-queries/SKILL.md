name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure, performant database queries using parameterized queries, proper eager loading, and transaction management. Use this skill when writing database queries, ORM operations, raw SQL statements, or repository methods. When working on files in repositories/, queries/, services/, or any code that interacts with the database. When optimizing query performance, preventing N+1 queries, implementing transactions, adding query timeouts, or caching expensive queries. When reviewing code for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing database queries (ORM or raw SQL)
- When creating repository or data access layer methods
- When working on files in repositories/, queries/, services/, or dal/ directories
- When using SELECT statements and choosing which columns to fetch
- When implementing eager loading or joins to prevent N+1 queries
- When wrapping related operations in database transactions
- When adding indexes to optimize WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY clauses
- When implementing query timeouts for long-running queries
- When caching results of expensive or frequently-run queries
- When reviewing code for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- When using parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
