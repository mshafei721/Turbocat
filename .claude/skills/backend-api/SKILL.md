name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following best practices for URL structure, HTTP methods, status codes, versioning, and rate limiting. Use this skill when creating or modifying API routes, controllers, endpoint handlers, or route files. When working on files like routes.ts, api/*.ts, controllers/*.ts, endpoints/*.py, views.py, or any server-side request handlers. When designing resource URLs, implementing CRUD operations, adding query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, or setting up API versioning. When reviewing or refactoring existing API code for REST compliance.

- When implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- When adding filtering, sorting, or pagination to endpoints
- When setting up API versioning (URL path or header-based)
- When choosing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When determining appropriate HTTP status codes for responses
- When designing resource-based URL structures
- When implementing rate limiting headers
- When reviewing API code for RESTful best practices
