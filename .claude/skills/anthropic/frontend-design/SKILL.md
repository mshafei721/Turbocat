# Frontend Design

## Overview

Craft visually striking frontend interfaces by committing to bold, intentional aesthetic directions rather than defaulting to common patterns.

## Design Strategy

Before coding, analyze:
- Purpose and intended audience
- Tone and emotional impact
- Technical constraints
- What will make the interface memorable through a specific conceptual lens

## Aesthetic Focus Areas

### Typography
Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter.

### Color & Theme
Establish cohesive palettes using CSS variables with:
- Dominant colors
- Sharp accents
- Considered contrast ratios

### Motion
Prioritize high-impact animations:
- Page-load sequences
- Scroll-triggered effects
- Micro-interactions

### Spatial Composition
- Asymmetry
- Overlap
- Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements

### Visual Details
Create atmosphere through:
- Gradients
- Textures
- Patterns
- Contextual effects

## Critical Avoidance

Do NOT create "generic AI-generated aesthetics":
- Overused typefaces
- Predictable layouts
- Cookie-cutter design lacking context-specific character
- Excessive centered layouts
- Default purple gradients
- Uniform rounded corners

## Implementation Approach

Match code complexity to the vision:
- Maximalist designs require elaborate animations
- Minimalist designs demand restraint and precision in spacing and typography

## Output

Production-ready code using:
- React components
- Tailwind CSS
- Modern CSS features
- Accessibility best practices
