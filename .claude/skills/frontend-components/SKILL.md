When designing component props and APIs, managing component state, composing smaller components into larger ones, refactoring monolithic components, or documenting component usage.

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new UI components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- When modifying existing component files
- When working on files in components/, ui/, widgets/, or src/components/ directories
- When designing component props and their default values
- When deciding where to manage state (local vs. lifted)
- When composing smaller components into larger UI structures
- When refactoring large, monolithic components into smaller pieces
- When naming components and their props descriptively
- When encapsulating implementation details within components
- When documenting component usage and prop interfaces
